# Find the GCD of two numbers

## AIM:
To write a program to find the GCD of two numbers using function.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
### Step 1:
Define a function.
### Step 2:
Get the two numbers from the user.
### Step 3: 
Compare the two values, to find the smaller number.
### Step 4:
Use for() and if() loop to find the GCD of the two numbers.

## Program:
#Program to findthe gcd of number usinf functions
#Developed By : THARUN D
#RgisterNumber : 23013993

def gcd():
    a=int(input())
    b=int(input())
    while b!=0:
        a,b=b,a%b
    print("GCD of two numbers is:",a)
~~~

## Output:
